title: Beacon
due: {[3.1]}
---

During the months of isolation and lockdown of the pandemic, our relationship with presence shifted. Many of us spent a longer than normal amount of time alone, and the version of presence we did have was highly mediated.

Though very difficult, the experience did highlight how effective small gestures can be to communicate care. Sometimes all that one needs is to know that someone is thinking of them, or that they are still there.

For this assignment I would like you to respond to the rather morbidly named mechanism of a [dead man’s switch](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dead_man%27s_switch#/Alternative_names) and similarly, the general concept of a beacon or lighthouse. Where a dead man’s switch is used to passively communicate that a body is still present or active, a beacon shows presence in a different way, announcing danger, calling for help, or just shouting into the void.

Your assignment is to create a device that serves as a beacon. It should use at least one button, and at least one LED. The button(s) can be used to create any kind of interaction you can imagine, it does not need to be limited to the basic format of a dead man’s switch.

Your project should include drawings along with a clear narrative surrounding your button to flesh out the world of this device, or to add details to how it is situated in your world.

A large part of any project is its presentation. You should make some kind of enclosure for your device. It doesn’t need to be overly sophisticated, but likewise it should not be a pile of wires and a breadboard. You can use any enclosure you can come up with, custom laser cut, foamcore, cardboard, or found objects, the only requirement is that your piece consider the enclosure as a key part of the overall project.

1. Create 5 sketches of ideas and objects. Make at least one of them as fantastical as you can, even if it is not technically possible.
2. Narrow down your ideas to a top 2 and flesh out what is required to create them. Include a list of parts and what is necessary to create the enclosure.
3. Bring all sketches and work to class on *Tuesday October, 4th* to discuss one-on-one.
4. Make an outline of how the software component of your project is going to work. Be able to tell the story of how your code runs and responds to the user.
5. Build your first prototype of the circuit. Planning a project that uses both hardware and software takes time, get started!
6. Iterate and refine your idea based on your prototype, design your enclosure and make sure everything will fit!
7. Complete the build!

### Objectives
* Get familiar with using buttons, LEDs, and software to create an object.
* Translate an idea into a functioning device.
* Learn limits of Arduino and how those can be overcome and circumvented using techniques like narrative and metaphor.
* Successfully plan and execute a complex project.

We will have an in-class critique on {[3.1]} bring your object and be prepared to present it to the class.
